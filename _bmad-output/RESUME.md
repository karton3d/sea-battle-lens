# Resume Workflow: Meme Fleet Battle

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13
**Project:** Meme Fleet Battle (Snap Lens Studio AR Game)
**Track:** BMGD Full Game Dev (Brownfield)

## Quick Resume

### Option 1: Workflow Status Command (Recommended)

```
/bmad:bmgd:workflows:workflow-status
```

This reads `bmgd-workflow-status.yaml` and tells you where you are.

---

### Option 2: Copy-Paste Prompt

```
I'm continuing development on Meme Fleet Battle (Snap Lens Studio game).

Context files (READ-ONLY, don't modify):
- PROJECT_PLAN.md - existing game documentation
- TURN_BASED_RESEARCH.md - multiplayer research

BMAD artifacts created:
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/codebase-analysis.md
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/test-strategy.md (DRAFT)

Current status: Phase 0 (Foundation Validation) COMPLETE
Next step: Phase 1 - Create GDD for multiplayer feature

Please read the workflow status file and continue:
_bmad-output/bmgd-workflow-status.yaml
```

---

## Current Progress

```
✅ PHASE 0: FOUNDATION VALIDATION - COMPLETE
   ├── ✅ codebase-analysis.md   - Code review, risks, technical debt
   ├── ✅ architecture.md        - System design, interfaces, data flow
   └── 📝 test-strategy.md       - DRAFT (needs validation session)

→  PHASE 1: DESIGN - NEXT
   └── ○ GDD                     - Document multiplayer feature design

○  PHASE 2: TECHNICAL
   ├── ○ architecture-update     - Multiplayer integration plan
   └── ○ test-framework          - Testing setup

○  PHASE 3: PRODUCTION
   └── ○ sprint-planning         - Stories & execution
```

## Separate Sessions

### Test Strategy Validation

The MCP server testing approach needs hands-on validation:

```
I want to validate the Lens Studio MCP server testing approach.

Read: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/test-strategy.md

Focus on Section 4 (MCP Server Automation) and Section 10 (Validation Checklist).
Help me test the MCP connection and verify if automated testing is feasible.
```

### Continue to GDD (Multiplayer Design)

```
Continue Meme Fleet Battle development.

Read these files first:
- _bmad-output/bmgd-workflow-status.yaml
- _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md
- PROJECT_PLAN.md (context only, don't modify)
- TURN_BASED_RESEARCH.md (context only, don't modify)

Start the GDD workflow for multiplayer feature design.
Command: /bmad:bmgd:workflows:create-gdd
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `bmgd-workflow-status.yaml` | Workflow tracking | Active |
| `planning-artifacts/codebase-analysis.md` | Code review | Complete |
| `planning-artifacts/architecture.md` | System design | Complete |
| `planning-artifacts/test-strategy.md` | Testing approach | DRAFT |

### Context Files (READ-ONLY)

These exist in project root - use for context but don't modify:

- `README.md` - Project overview
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Development roadmap (v0.3 complete)
- `TURN_BASED_RESEARCH.md` - Multiplayer API research
- `SNAP_LENS_STUDIO_API.md` - API reference
- `AI_PROMPTS_GUIDE.md` - Image generation prompts

## Project Summary

**Meme Fleet Battle** is an AR Battleship game for Snapchat where players hunt meme objects (cows, toilets, etc.) instead of ships.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Single Player | ✅ Complete (v0.3) |
| Multiplayer | ⬜ Not started |
| Visual Polish | ⬜ Not started |

**Next Milestone:** v0.4 - Multiplayer with Turn-Based

---

## Critical Risks (From Analysis)

Before multiplayer development, address:

1. **Duplicate State** - GameManager and Grid both track ships
2. **Fragile Coupling** - Component lookup via `getComponents()`
3. **No Turn Manager** - AI logic mixed in GameManager

See `architecture.md` for recommended interfaces.
